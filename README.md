Altimetric-Data-Check


This repository contains:
1. River water level altimetric data from multiple sources for two basins: Niger and Ganges-Brahmaputra.
2. A MATLAB script for performing a simple analysis and visualization of this data.


Latest MATLAB Script:
the script (Altimetry_DataCheck_V8.m) Visualizes the time series of water levels at all virtual stations. Plots the stations' locations on a map in two different ways:
A scatter plot where the color represents the mean water level at each station.
A map that separates stations based on the source of the altimetric data.
